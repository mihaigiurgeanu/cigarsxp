<p>I am a novice about growing tobacco (or any other plant, as a matter of fact) and, until few days ago
  I knew nothing about how a cigar is made.

  This site is about sharing my experience growing my own tobacco and rolling my own cigars. It describes
  everything I did since the beginning, when I first had the thought of doing this. I am sharing this
  experience hoping that will help you if you want to learn how to roll your own cigars or how to grow
  your own tobacco.</p>

<p>If you read articles of this blog, you will find things about motivation of making your own cigars,
  how I planed everything, what things worked out, what things did not, you will find ideas about
  combining different blends of tobacco. And everything done as a hobby, meaning with little effort,
  and very small expenses.</p>

<p>If you do find my articles interesting, I'd be very, very glad to hear from you. Also, if you have
  ideas please share them with me and other readers by commenting on the articles.</p>
