<p>I am a novice growing tobacco (or any other plant, as a matter of fact) and, until few days ago,
  I knew nothing about how a cigar is made.

  This site is about sharing my experience trying to plant and grow my own tobacco and roll my own cigars.
  It describes
  everything I did since the beginning, when I first had the thought of doing this. I am sharing this
  experience hoping that will help you if you want to learn how to roll your own cigars or how to grow
  your own tobacco.</p>

<p>This blog's articles will contain things about motivation of making your own cigars,
  how I planed everything, what things worked out, what things did not, you will find ideas about
  combining different blends of tobacco and also how to guides that will come from my experience.
  And everything done as a hobby, meaning with little effort, and very small expenses.</p>

<p>If you do find my articles interesting, I'd be very, very glad to hear from you. Also, if you have
  ideas please share them with me and other readers by commenting on the articles.</p>
